      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>As a Full Stack Software Developer, I look to design solutions that encompass the whole of a system. 
        With my experience as a professional engineer, I know how to consider problems holistically and find novel ways to address those challenges. 
        Earning a reputation among my peers as an intuitive leader, I can jump into any situation and add value through my teamwork, creativity, and technical abilities. Having successfully improved my organizationâ€™s communication skills and policy by establishing a data visualization center, I chose to foster my talents in software engineering. </p>
    <p>Armed with a solid JavaScript background and certification in Full Stack Development from Johns Hopkins University, I am ready to apply my full stack skills (including node, express, databases, data analytics, and collaborative workflows) to a team in need of a talented developer with a classic engineering foundation.</p>

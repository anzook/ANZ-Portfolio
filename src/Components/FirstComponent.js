      <p>
      As a Full Stack Software Developer, I look to design solutions that encompass the whole of a system. 
        With my experience as a professional engineer, I know how to consider problems holistically and find novel ways to address those challenges. 
        Earning a reputation among my peers as an intuitive leader, I can jump into any situation and add value through my teamwork, creativity, and technical abilities. Having successfully improved my organizationâ€™s communication skills and policy by establishing a data visualization center, I chose to foster my talents in software engineering.
